Description
==========================
This module provides an interface to the LTS UW GWS plugin.  This module
fetches a list of groups and creates them as local Drupal roles.  When a
user logs in, the module checks membership through LTS and then assigns
the local Drupal user to the local Drupal roles.

This module also provides hooks for the UW Pubcookie module to ensure that
only users of a certain role are allowed to log in to the site (or even
be created locally).

Created by the University of Washington Information School; see LICENSE file.


Install
==========================
Move folder to DRUPAL_ROOT/sites/all/modules and rename to "uwgroups".  Enable
the module in Drupal.  NOTE: LTS and the UW Groups LTS plugin will have to
be setup before this module will work.
